Usage:
~~~~~~
    java -jar HeritrixRemote.jar %1 %2 %3 %4 [%5]

        %1 = Heritrix host and port, like "localhost:8443"
        %2 = Heritrix username and password, like "admin:admin"
        %3 = command (see below)
        %4 = job identifier or job filter (see below)
        %5 = additional arguments (command specific)


Job identifier:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To identify a job, specify its directory name or its first seed URL.
The specified URL will be transformed to a directory name - see description of
'create' command below for more information.

Examples:
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin status http://www.site.com/
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin pause http-www-site-com


Job filters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter jobs by their states which can be one of the following:
    unbuilt, ready, paused, running, finished

You can also apply a command to all jobs, typing "all" as job filter.

Examples:
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin status all
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin build unbuilt
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin unpause paused

You can call every command with filter "all". If a command is not applicable to
a job because of its state, it will be skipped. For example, a running job will
be skipped when calling "build all".


Commands:
~~~~~~~~~

status

    Prints out status information of the job/jobs. Status information includes
    job state (unbuilt, ready, paused, running, finished) and the start date of
    the crawl.

    Examples:

    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin status http://www.site.com/
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin status all


create URL1[,URL2,URL3,...] [use CXML-NAME]

    Creates a job with the specified seed URLs. You can pass more than one URL
    separated by commas. Job identifier will be the first one. The name of the
    job directory will be generated from this by replacing non-alphanumeric
    character sequences with '-'.

    Example: "http://www.site.com/" -> "http-www-site-com"

    If you have an own crawler-beans.cxml template which only need the seed URLs
    to be inserted, you can pass it to HeritrixRemote using the "use" argument
    as shown above. HeritrixRemote will insert the seed URLs, then pushes the
    file to Heritrix.

build

    Builds an unbuilt job. Building process means that Heritrix creates the Java
    objects the CXML file, they are needed to run the crawl.

launch

    Launches a ready (built) job. Heritrix will pause the crawl after preparing
    the job for launch. You should wait a few seconds before calling Heritrix on
    the same job again.

pause

    Pauses a running job.

unpause

    Unpauses a paused job.

teardown

    Tears down a paused or finished job. It means that Heritrix will discard the
    Java objects created at build, so the job will remain unbuilt after this
    call.

terminate

    Terminates a paused, running or finished job. Heritrix will do some further
    operations after this call, so you should wait a few seconds before calling
    Heritrix on the same job again. The job will remain finished after this
    call.

store JOB/FILTER ARCHIVE-DIRECTORY

    This operation has 3 requirements:
     * Heritrix and HeritrixRemote must be on the same machine
     * selected jobs must be configured to use MirrorWriterProcessor as their
       warcWriter
     * selected jobs must be finished (jobs with different states will be
       skipped)

    When calling "store", HeritrixRemote will move the contents of the job's
    "mirror" directory to your archive directory, under a folder with the name
    of the job's start date.

    Example:
        heritrix/job/http-site-com/mirror/*

        will be moved to

        your-archive-directory/20130525/*
