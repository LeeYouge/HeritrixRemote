Usage:
~~~~~~
    java -jar HeritrixRemote.jar %1 %2 %3 %4 [%5]

        %1 = Heritrix host and port, like "localhost:8443"
        %2 = Heritrix username and password, like "admin:admin"
        %3 = command (see below)
        %4 = job identifier or job filter (see below)
        %5 = additional arguments (command specific)


Job identifier:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To identify a job, specify its first seed URL.

Examples:
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin status http://www.site.com/
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin pause http://www.site.com/


Job filters:
~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can filter jobs by their states which can be one of the following:
    unbuilt, ready, paused, running, finished

You can also apply a command to all jobs, typing "all" as job filter.

Examples:
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin status all
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin build unbuilt
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin unpause paused

Commands:
~~~~~~~~~

status

    Prints out status information of the given job/jobs. Status information
    includes job state (unbuilt, ready, paused, running, finished) and the start
    date of the crawl.

    Examples:

    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin status http://www.site.com/
    HeritrixRemote.jar localhost:8443 admin:admin status all


create URL1[,URL2,URL3,...] [use CXML-NAME]

    Creates a job with the specified seed URLs. You can pass more than one URL
    separated by commas. Job identifier will be the first one. The name of the
    job directory will be generated from this by replacing non-alphanumeric
    character sequences with '-'.

    If you have an own crawler-beans.cxml template which only need the seed URLs
    to be inserted, you can pass it to HeritrixRemote using the "use" argument
    as shown above. HeritrixRemote will insert the seed URLs, then pushes the
    file to Heritrix.
